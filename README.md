Examples of using MIKE IO

As a collection of notebooks, with the benefit of being able to directly link to a specific section, .e.g <https://dhi.github.io/mikeio-examples/notebooks/Dfsu_-_2D_interpolation.html#save-to-geotiff>

This site was an experiment that will be transitioned to https://dhi.github.io/mikeio/examples/.
